My own vcs

## ...but why?
Why not? It's a great way for me to get into C, and I had some ideas for stuff I'd want in a vcs, so this is that.

## What can it do?
Not that much yet... it's VERY work in progress. Right now you can:
- display a help page
- initialize a repo with a meta file (that does not to much yet)
- save the main.c file in the repo
- prevent errors where I saw them

## Should I use it for my project when it's done?


### Short answer: Probably not.

### Long answer:

#### You might want to use this if:
- you are looking for a local vcs for small to mid-size projects where you are working alone
- you just want to version your code and not branch/merge/whatever
- you don't care about industry standards

#### You should not use this if:
- you want to collaborate with others or access your code from anywhere (no server (yet?))
- you want a robust, tried and true vcs solution or care about industry standards
- you need anything beyond commits (e.g.: branches, merging, pull requests)
